# 3D-Fractal-Tree

A 3D fractal "like" pine tree!

# Requriments: 

1. ✔ Use 3D segements of choice (3D line segement, cylinder, cone, or anything else)
2. ✔ Each branch should be at 60 degree angle from the parent facing toward the end of the end of the parent branch
3. ✔ Each branch is scattered around the the parent branch (randomly or predefined)
4. ✔ Make the depth and branches configurable
   
   
# Extra:
1. ✔ Being able to add a branch using your mouse
2. ✔ Have the branches rotate along the parent, perserving their angle

## Installation:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`


## Tree Configuration:

## Branch Length
The branch length at which the tree starts at

## Branch Starting Thickness
The branch thickness at which the tree starts at

## Stem to stem ratio
The percentage at which the next stem should be of the previous stem

## Stem to branch ratio
The percentage at which the next branch should be of the previous stem

## Branch Color
The branch color to be used

## Branch Angle
The branch angle at which the branch should be from its parent

## Axis Rotation
How much the branch should rotate from its parent (along the y-axis)

## Random Axis Rotation
This will randomly rotate the branches from negative to positive axis rotation angle (ie, -50 to 50 degrees)

## Depth
How deep should the recusion happen for the tree

## Branches
How many branches should each step in the recusion should have

## Roots
Give the tree some roots!

## Leafs
Give the tree some leafs! They get **bigger** the deeper the recusion!

## Animate
Animate the tree to have the branches spin around its parent
